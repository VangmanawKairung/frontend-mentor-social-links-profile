## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries for responsive design
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### What I learned

- **Layout-first workflow**: I learned that starting with the layout first and then adding details later makes the development process much faster and more efficient.
- **Centering with position and translate**: I learned why using `position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%;` places the element’s top-left corner in the center. Adding `translate(-50%, -50%)` repositions the element so its center aligns with the parent’s center.
- **Alternative centering methods**: I learned that using flexbox or grid is a cleaner and more modern approach for centering elements compared to the position/translate method.
- **CSS custom properties (variables)**: I learned that defining CSS variables by usage area (e.g., `--button-bg, --card-bg`) is more practical and makes the code easier to maintain than naming them after literal colors.
- **Responsive design with media queries**: I learned how to apply media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, following a mobile-first approach and then scaling up to desktop.
- **Hover states for interactivity**: I learned how to use hover effects (`:hover`) on buttons to provide visual feedback, making the interface more interactive.
- **Accessibility with aria-label**: I learned the importance of `aria-label` for accessibility, especially for interactive elements like social links that might use icons or generic text, ensuring screen readers can describe them clearly.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility. In particular, I plan to practice implementing `aria-label` properly to make interactive elements more user-friendly for screen readers and to ensure the website feels more complete and professional.
